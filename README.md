# MSA-Azure Website Report


Link to website: https://msaazuresubmission.azurewebsites.net

Website for my MSA Azure and Cloud Workshop submission, featuring my art portfolio/resume. Upon entering, you
are met with the homepage, with links to an about, contact and art page.




## Current issues with the website

Currently to view the art, you enter through the category rather than a button with a link to the page. The category
link clashes with the button visuals and makes the page seem disorderly. I've been trying to have a page with links to
all of my posts with cropped featured art icons, but I have been unable to figure out a method other than putting all the
posts under a single category and then putting the category link as a button as opposed to having a button link to a
page with all the links. Once entered the post page it displays the image twice, but if I remove the second image the
featured image does not appear, and I don't wish to have any text on those pages.

## Type of plugins that will solve the issue and why?

A front-end page builder plugin would solve this issue, prefereablly one that can crop images so that the preview 
images would be uniform in size, and allows the image to have a link to the post page. This would solve the issue as
rather than have a category link, I could link a button to a page with a gallery of images, and then have the images 
link to the individual image post pages.

## Choice of plugin provider and why I chose one plugin provider over the others.

I chose Elementor over other front-end page builder plugins such as Divi as it felt more flexible in use, and 
personally felt more simple and efficient to use. For my SEO plugin, I chose the All in One SEO Pack as being a 
novice in wordpress, it's easily implemented as it walks the user through the set up process. I used LiteSpeed
Cache rather than other cache cleaning plugins such as W3 Total Cache as after activating the plugin it
automatically starts cleaning cache from pagse improving performance rates, rather than having to seperately download 
other files to function, making the process quick and easy. For an analytics plugin I chose Koko Analytics due to it 
being advertised as being privacy-friendly with no involvement with any third parties.

## The high-level steps of how I implemented each plugin, and the applicable benefits realized or expected to be realized after implementing each plugin.

All of the plugins I found were easily implemented as they only needed to be activated. Using the Koko Analytics 
I was able to observe the number of page views per day, and was able to figure out which one of my pages had most traffic.
Using this knowledge I tried to make the page more appealing and linked it to the other lesser viewed pages so that users
could travel around the site easier. With the LiteSpeed Cache and All in One SEO Pack, both automatically started running
once activated. Due to the site having almost to no traffic, it barely had any cache it needed to remove. For Elementor,
I attempted to use it to fix my issue, however it was unable to crop the images and it's portfolio option was only avaible
after purchase. It ended up not making any difference to the default Wordpress editor, and after exploring other front-end
page builder plugins, nothing really gave me the desired result. I decided to ultimately leave it as it is, as it still
serves its intended purpose, but only looks messy doing so.
